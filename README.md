# Share Portfolio Visualizer #

This is a website built in ReactJS designed to help you visualize your stock portfolio. It currently requires you 
to manually add in your share portfolio into the program.

The website is intended to be reasonably lightweight and static so the data entered into it does not persist between
sessions.

Start the program by running "npm start" in the root directory.
